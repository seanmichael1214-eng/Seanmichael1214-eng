# Hi there, I'm a builder of Enterprise Data Tools. 👋

I specialize in **"Vibe Coding"**—rapidly developing high-value, niche software accelerators using AI-augmented workflows. My focus is on solving complex data migration challenges in the Pharma/SAP space without the enterprise bloat.

### 🚀 Featured Project: Data Steward ALPHA
**A Client-Side Data Validation Hub for SAP S/4HANA Migration**

I built this tool to help Data Stewards audit legacy pharmaceutical data instantly, without sending sensitive files to a server.

* **The Problem:** Legacy ERP data is full of bad DEA numbers and broken addresses, causing SAP load failures.
* **The Solution:** A secure, browser-based React app that parses CSVs, validates logic, and uses AI to fix errors.
* **Key Features:**
    * ✅ **DEA Logic Engine:** Mathematically validates DEA checksums (2 letters + 7 digits).
    * ✅ **AI Address Normalization:** Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to standardize formats to USPS.
    * ✅ **Privacy First:** 100% Client-side processing (CSV never leaves the browser).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* **Data Processing:** PapaParse, Lucide React
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API
* **Deployment:** Replit / Vercel

### 💼 Services
I build **White-Label PoCs (Proof of Concepts)** for consultants and agencies.
* Need a custom data validator?
* Need a rapid prototype for a client pitch?
