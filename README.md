### Portable Cloud Server Infrastructure
**Systems Architect**

Converted a carrier-locked Android phone into a production-grade Ubuntu server for local LLM hosting and development.

**Architecture:**
- Ubuntu 25.10 via proot-distro (rootless containerization)
- 83GB storage for model weights and databases
- SSH-based remote access with key authentication
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite database hosting

**Use Cases:**
- Local LLM inference (quantized models)
- MCP server hosting (24/7 availability)
- Development environment (Python, Node.js)
- Data persistence layer for agentic workflows

**Key Achievement:** $0 infrastructure cost vs $240/year cloud VPS
