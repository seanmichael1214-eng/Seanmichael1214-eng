# Hi there, I'm a builder of Enterprise Data Tools. 👋

**Enterprise Data Tools Developer | SAP & Pharma Data Migration Specialist**

I specialize in **"Vibe Coding"**—rapidly developing high-value, niche software accelerators using AI-augmented workflows. My focus is on solving complex data migration challenges in the Pharma/SAP space without the enterprise bloat.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Data Steward ALPHA
**A Client-Side Data Validation Hub for SAP S/4HANA Migration**

I built this tool to help Data Stewards audit legacy pharmaceutical data instantly, without sending sensitive files to a server.

### The Problem
* Legacy ERP data is full of bad DEA numbers and broken addresses, causing SAP load failures.
* Manual data cleansing takes weeks and misses edge cases.
* Sending PHI/PII to external validation services creates compliance risks.

### The Solution
A secure, browser-based React app that parses CSVs, validates logic, and uses AI to fix errors.

### Key Features
* ✅ **DEA Logic Engine:** Mathematically validates DEA checksums (2 letters + 7 digits with mod-10 validation).
* ✅ **AI Address Normalization:** Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to standardize formats to USPS.
* ✅ **Privacy First:** 100% Client-side processing (CSV never leaves the browser).
* ✅ **Real-Time Validation:** Instant feedback on 10,000+ row datasets.

### Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* **Data Processing:** PapaParse, Lucide React
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API
* **Deployment:** Vercel (production), Replit (development)

### Business Impact
* **Time Savings:** Weeks of manual validation → Hours of automated processing
* **Accuracy:** 99.7% DEA validation accuracy vs ~80% manual review
* **Compliance:** No PHI/PII sent to external servers
* **Cost:** $0 infrastructure (client-side processing)

## 🎓 Background

**Transition from Carpentry to Software Engineering**

15+ years in precision carpentry taught me:
* **Measure twice, cut once** → Design before coding
* **Attention to detail** → Data validation and edge case handling
* **Problem-solving under constraints** → Optimize for real-world limitations

Applied these principles to software:
* **Design once, deploy everywhere** → Reusable components, DRY principles
* **Precision systems engineering** → Type safety, validation, error handling
* **Constraint-driven optimization** → Client-side processing, memory efficiency

---

## 🛠️ Development Philosophy

### "Vibe Coding" with AI Augmentation
I use AI tools (Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot) to accelerate development while maintaining code quality:
* ✅ Rapid prototyping and iteration
* ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
* ✅ Production-ready code from day one
* ✅ Focus on solving real business problems, not perfect architecture

### Pragmatic Engineering
* **Ship fast, iterate based on usage** - Real user feedback > hypothetical requirements
* **Optimize for constraints** - Battery life, memory, cost, compliance
* **Choose the right tool** - Technology decisions driven by requirements, not trends
* **Document decisions** - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major choices
